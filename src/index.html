        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I'm Tim Bennett, a full-stack web developer from Memphis, TN. I'm the main dev for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://teamzero.com/">ZERO</a>, an app that makes it easy for companies to track, manage, and report safety issues with a modern web app.</p>
        <p>Outside of work I like to start projects I'll never finish, usually something to do with games, apps, or electronics. My wife and I are avid board-game fans with over 70 games in our collection. One day I'll get around to actually cataloging it. Oh, and I also have four dogs, so that means I have sixteen paws to clean when it rains outside.</p>
